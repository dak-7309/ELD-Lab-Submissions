Take input from two brams, do the sum and store the BCD output in the FIFO (using built-in
FIFO). One BRAM coe file will consist of your name letters and other files will contain
numbers from 0-9. eg - Take 0 for a, 1 for b .... and so on.
Read the sum value from FIFO one by one using the push button. Display the output on the
onboard SSD.
