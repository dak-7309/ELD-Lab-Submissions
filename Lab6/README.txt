Design a door lock circuit with passcode as “CCD”. The code should be entered using PMOD
keypad and the user can enter the code of any length. The user must push “Enter” push
button to indicate that he has entered a complete code. Based on the entered code, display
one of the three outputs on the SSD
1) “PASS” when complete code has been entered and it is correct,
2) “FAIL” when complete code has been entered and it is wrong, and
3) “INV” when entered code is either less or more than 3 digits.
